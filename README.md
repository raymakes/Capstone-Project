# Pet Tails

<p>Similar to mainstream social media like Facebook/Instagram, but you can make multiple "mini users" of your cats. Each mini user can have their own profile picture, bio blurb, birthday, and other fun facts on their page. Along with that, you can upload a picture and have it appear only on a specific mini user's page and it will not show up on the other mini users you have. Or, if you select multiple mini users, the picture will show up on all the profiles chosen.</p>
